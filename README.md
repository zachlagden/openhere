# selfhost

A self-hosted, open source alternative to here.now: hosting for already built static sites, aimed at AI agents, with a dashboard and a REST API. It targets one person or a small team running it on a VPS. It is not a public sign-up service.

"selfhost" is a placeholder name and will change.

## Status

Early development. The server starts, loads its configuration, connects to the database, applies migrations and serves the authentication API: first-time setup, login, sessions and API keys. There is no dashboard, no site hosting and no workspaces yet.

## First-time setup

A new instance has no users, so whoever reaches it first could claim it. To prevent that, the server generates a random setup token at startup while the database has no users. It keeps the token in memory and logs it once at info level, together with the setup path:

```json
{"level":"INFO","msg":"setup required: send this token with the first setup request","setup_path":"/api/v1/setup","setup_token":"..."}
```

Create the root user by sending that token with the first request. The server discards the token after setup, and a restart on a configured instance logs no token.

```sh
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/v1/setup \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"email":"alex@example.com","password":"a password of 12 or more characters","setupToken":"<token from the log>"}'
```

Passwords need 12 to 128 characters. Emails are ASCII only and stored in lower case.

## API

`docs/openapi.yaml` describes every endpoint (OpenAPI 3.1). The server does not serve it yet. Only `GET /api/v1/setup/status`, `POST /api/v1/setup` and `POST /api/v1/auth/login` work without credentials. Every other path returns a JSON 401, or a JSON 404 once signed in.

- Browsers sign in with a session cookie (HttpOnly, SameSite=Lax, Secure over HTTPS, 30 days, renewed on use). State-changing requests that use the cookie must send an `X-Requested-With` header and an `Origin` header that matches the host.
- Scripts and agents use `Authorization: Bearer <key>` with a key from `POST /api/v1/me/keys`. The response shows the full key once. The server stores only its SHA-256 hash. Each user can hold 50 active keys.
- Errors are JSON: `{"code": "...", "message": "...", "retry_after": 30}`. `retry_after` appears on 429 responses.

### Rate limits

Login and setup are limited per IP address and per email: login allows 30 attempts per IP and 10 per email in 15 minutes, setup allows 10 per IP and 5 per email. The counters live in process memory, so a restart resets them and each server process counts separately. A successful login resets that email's counter.

### Running behind a reverse proxy

Set `TRUSTED_PROXIES` to the addresses of your proxy. The server then reads the client address from `X-Forwarded-For` and decides whether to set the Secure cookie flag from `X-Forwarded-Proto`, but only for requests that arrive from those addresses. Without it, every client appears to be the proxy and shares one rate limit. The proxy must pass the original `Host` header, because the CSRF check compares it with `Origin`.

## Configuration

The server reads these environment variables.

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `LISTEN_ADDR` | `:8080` | Address the HTTP server listens on, as `host:port` or `:port`. |
| `DATA_DIR` | `./data` (`/data` in the Docker image) | Directory for the SQLite database file `selfhost.db`. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | unset | PostgreSQL connection URL. When unset, the server uses SQLite in `DATA_DIR`. |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | One of `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`. Logs are JSON on standard output. |
| `SENTRY_DSN` | unset | Enables error reporting through the Sentry SDK. A self-hosted GlitchTip works. |
| `API_KEY_PREFIX` | `sk_` | Constant prefix of generated API keys, 1 to 16 letters, digits or underscores. Changing it invalidates existing keys. |
| `TRUSTED_PROXIES` | unset | Comma-separated IP addresses or CIDR ranges of reverse proxies. The server reads `X-Forwarded-For` and `X-Forwarded-Proto` only from these peers. |

`.env.example` lists the same keys with fake values. The server does not load `.env` files itself, so export the variables or pass them to Docker.

## Run with Docker

```sh
docker build -t selfhost .
docker run -p 8080:8080 -v selfhost-data:/data selfhost
```

To use PostgreSQL, add `-e DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:5432/dbname`.

## Run from source

You need the Go version in `go.mod`.

```sh
go run ./cmd/selfhost
```

## Development

```sh
gofmt -l .
go vet ./...
golangci-lint run
go test ./...
```

`go test` runs the database tests against SQLite. To run them against PostgreSQL as well, set `TEST_DATABASE_URL` to a test database. The store tests drop the tables they create. The auth and API tests create a schema of their own per test and drop it afterwards.
